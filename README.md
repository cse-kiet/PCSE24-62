Project Title: A Web Based Food Based Connecting System: Waste To Wealth

Abstract:In today’s world, the issue of food wastage has be- come a significant concern, particularly in the hospitality industry where surplus food is a common occurrence.
This research paper explores a dual approach to managing surplus food in hotels and messes. The approach involves categorizing surplus food into two types: eatable food and non-eatable food.
Eatable food, which remains safe for consumption, can be distributed to nearby slums to feed hungry individuals in real-time. On the other hand, non- eatable food can be transported to bio
gas plants to produce renewable energy. This paper examines the feasibility, benefits, and challenges associated with each approach, highlighting the potential for sustainability and social impact.
In today’s world, the hospitality industry stands at a critical juncture where the imperative of sustainability intersects with the pressing need to address food insecurity. With the stag- gering
amount of food wasted annually, hotels and messes find themselves in a unique position to make a substantial impact on both fronts. Surplus food, a common byproduct of their operations, represents
not only a missed opportunity but also a glaring ethical and environmental concern. This research paper delves into a novel approach to managing surplus food in hotels and messes, proposing a dual
strategy that aims to maximize social, environmental, and economic benefits. By categorizing surplus food into two distinct typeseatable and non-eatable – this approach offers a pragmatic solution
that addresses both immediate hunger relief and long-waste into a valuable resource, yielding bio gas for electricity generation and nutrient-rich dig-estate for agricultural use. By adopting this
dual approach, hotels and messes can mitigate their environmental footprint, contribute to local communities, and demonstrate a commitment to sustainability and social responsibility. However, the
implementation of such initiatives is not without its challenges, ranging from logistical complex- ities to regulatory hurdles. Nonetheless, with proper planning, stakeholder collaboration, and
innovation, these   challenges can be overcome, paving the way for a more resilient and inclusive food system. In the following sections, this paper will explore the feasibility, benefits, challenges
, and best practices associated with the proposed approach, drawing on existing literature, case studies, and real-world examples. By shedding light on this innovative strategy, it is hoped that this
research will inspire and inform efforts to transform surplus food management in the hospitality industry, ushering in a more sustainable and equitable future.
